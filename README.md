## Machine-Learning-techniques-with-Apache-Spark

This workshop was providing a hands on introduction to basic Machine Learning techniques with Apache Spark ML using the cloud. 

This repository contains the hands on notes on machine learning examples with Spark ML.

I used Databricks Community Edition's free version of our cloud-based big data platform, https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html?


## spark.ml VS spark.mllib

- spark.mllib contains the original API built on top of RDDs. 

- spark.ml provides higher-level API built on top of DataFrames for constructing ML pipelines.

ML is the new implementation + Pipelines + Dataframes + Easier to construct a practical machine learning pipeline
